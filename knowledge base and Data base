Expert System Knowledge Base VS Database
In the domain of Expert Systems and Machine Learning, it's crucial to differentiate between a knowledge base and a database, understanding their respective roles and functions.

Knowledge Base:

A knowledge base operates as a repository for domain-specific knowledge, rules, and expertise utilized in expert systems and decision-making processes. It typically comprises organized domain-specific information intended for problem-solving. In the context of expert systems, the knowledge base consists of rules and facts that govern the decision-making process.

Database:

A database, on the other hand, serves as a structured repository for data storage, retrieval, and management. Databases are designed to store raw data and enable structured querying and retrieval. In the realm of machine learning, databases frequently contain extensive datasets employed for training and testing machine learning models. However, they do not inherently incorporate domain-specific rules and knowledge for decision-making, unlike a knowledge base.
